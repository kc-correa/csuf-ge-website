# CSUF Hackathon Submission

## G&E Website for Hackathon!

Our website submission! By Katherine Correa and Andrew Lam

### About
Over the winter break, I wanted to try out a little web development as I enjoyed working with HTML and CSS in the Fall semester. I decided I wanted to try and make a mock website for a club that I'm a part of that doesn't have a website. Unfortunately, I never found the time to actually start it before school started, and once classes started, I could never start it.

With the announcement of TuffyHacks, I decided that now would be the perfect time to start the project and see what we could create in 24 hours with the help of my partner, Andrew Lam.

### Tools and IDE's Used
* Visual Studio Code
* Figma (used to layout what the website could look like; board member images on landing page were also used from Figma)
* Photo assets (neon sign on landing page and CSUF Gaming shield) provided by CSUF G&E

### Home/Landing Page
* Shows the image of the club logo to give a little preview/taste to intrigue the user. They can scroll down to learn what the club is about and when meetings are held.
* Four board members are shown to show who makes up the G&E board. Visitors can learn about other board members by clicking the Board page (to be implemented later) or by clicking the "View More Board Members" button (to be implemented later).
* Socials can be found at the bottom of the page. Clicking the icons will redirect to the respective social media page.

### Board Members Page
* Shows all the names of the board members, their images, positions, and majors.

### FAQ Page
* Visitors can look at frequently asked questions to clear up any questions they may have.

### Esports Page
* If any students want to see if there is a collegiate esports team for a game they're interested in competing for, they can check this page.
* Tryout forms are also hyperlinked here for already available teams if students are interested in trying out.

### Note
* 3/28/2021 Update: This is not a real website and it has yet to be. For now, this is a passion project and is in its first iteration. Many updates may come in the future.
