                        <h3>What games are played during the meetings?</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>The club has game nights that include all genres from FPS to board games. Although we currently have a semester schedule for each game night already, the club is
                        always open to new suggestions and we encourage people to play games within the voice channels at any time.</p>

                    </header>
                    <p>CSUF officially offers teams for Overwatch, Valorant, League of Legends, and Rocket League.</p>
        
                    <!-- Question 2 -->

                        <h3>How many teams are there?</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>We have one Varsity team per game, and club teams can be made based on interest.</p>
        
                    <!-- Question 3 -->
                    <header>
                        <h3>What do I need to be eligible for CSUF Esports?</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>In order to participate in CSUF Esports, you must be a full-time student with a minimum of 12 units for the semester, in addition to maintaining good standing with the
                        campus (minimum 2.0 GPA). Incoming freshman do not require a GPA.</p>
        
                    <!-- Question 4 -->
                    <header>
                        <h3>Can I still try out after the team has been formed?</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>If you wish to join an existing team, contact the appropriate team manager with your rank and availability.</p>
        
                    <!-- Question 5 -->
                    <header>
                        <h3>Can I represent CSUF Esports if I am not on a team?</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>Being a part of CSUF Esports requires players to sign a contract. Any student can participate in the same tournaments as the Esports teams, but cannot represent CSUF
                        Esports without signing said contract.</p>
        
                    <!-- Question 6 -->
                    <header>
                        <h3>Why don't you have a team for [insert game]?</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>More than likely, if we don't have a team for a game, it is because the game either doesn't have enough interest or there hasn't been any initiative to start one.</p>
        
                    <!-- Question 7 -->
                    <header>
                        <h3>I want to make a team for a game that isn't featured at CSUF. What do I do?</h3>
                    </header>
                    <p>In order to start a team for a new game, there needs to be enough interest from players to start a team. Then, interested parties must schedule a meeting with the board.
                        After getting approved, tryouts will be conducted and the team will be finalized after creating an official roster.</p>
